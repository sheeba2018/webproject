     <h2>AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and  XML):</h2>
      
      <p>AJAX is not a programming language. AJAX just uses a combination of:

       A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
       JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)</p>

      <p>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        https://www.seguetech.com/ajax-technology/
        Ajax is not a programming language or a tool, but a concept. Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh. The best definition I’ve read for Ajax is “the method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page – without reloading the entire page.” Ajax itself is mostly a generic term for various JavaScript techniques used to connect to a web server dynamically without necessarily loading multiple pages. In a more narrowly-defined sense, it refers to the use of XmlHttpRequest objects to interact with a web server dynamically via JavaScript.
      </p>

      <P>
        Ajax was originally an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. “Asynchronous” means that multiple events are happening independently of one another. Once a client initializes an Ajax callback to the server, the client will not need to wait for a response and can continue to use the web application while the request is being processed. Once done, the server will send a response back to the client and the client will process it as necessary.
      </P>

      <h4>There are 4 main benefits of using Ajax in web applications:</h4>
      
    
      <p>1.Callbacks: Ajax is used to perform a callback, making a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without posting the entire page back to the server. By not performing a full postback and sending all form data to the server, network utilization is minimized and quicker operations occur. In sites and locations with restricted bandwidth, this can greatly improve network performance. Most of the time, the data being sent to and from the server is minimal. By using callbacks, the server is not required to process all form elements. By sending only the necessary data, there is limited processing on the server. There is no need to process all form elements, process the ViewState, send images back to the client, or send a full page back to the client.</p>

      <p>2.Making Asynchronous Calls: Ajax allows you to make asynchronous calls to a web server. This allows the   client browser to avoid waiting for all data to arrive before allowing the user to act once more.</p>

      <p> 3.User-Friendly: Because a page postback is being eliminated, Ajax enabled applications will always be more   responsive, faster and more user-friendly.</p>

      <p>4.Increased Speed: The main purpose of Ajax is to improve the speed, performance and usability of a web application. A great example of Ajax is the movie rating feature on Netflix. The user rates a movie and their personal rating for that movie will be saved to their database without waiting for the page to refresh or reload. These movie ratings are being saved to their database without posting the entire page back to the server.</p>    
      <h4> Adavantges  of Ajax</h4>
      <p>
       1.AJAX make asynchronous calls to a web server. This means client browsers are avoid waiting for all data arrive before start the rendering.
       2.Reduce the server traffic in both side request. Also reducing the time consuming on both side response.
       3.XMLHttpRequest has an important role in the Ajax web development technique. XMLHttpRequest is special JavaScript object that was designed by Microsoft. XMLHttpRequest object call as a asynchronous HTTP request to the Server for transferring data both side. It's used for making requests to the non-Ajax pages.
       4.No require to completely reload page again. AJAX is improve the speed and performance. Fetching data from database and storing data into database perform background without reloading page.
       5.This is the biggest advantage. Form are common element in web page. Validation should be instant and properly, AJAX gives you all of that, and more.
        </p>

      <h4> DisAdvantage of Ajax</h4>
      <p>
       1.Ajax can't do the communication of cross domain.
       2.AJAX application would be a mistake because search engines would not be able to index an AJAX application.
       3.Search engines would not be able to index an AJAX application.
       4.The server information can not be accessed within AJAX.
       5.AJAX is not well integrated with any browser.
       6.ActiveX requests are enabled only in IE 5 and IE6
       7.Data of all requests is URL-encoded, which increases the size of the request.
